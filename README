Rhythmbox data from Last.fm
GPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>

Currently the project is two script files:
 * mergeplays.py
 * rate5loved.py

ABOUT THE SCRIPTS
-----------------
I have used Last.fm for a lot longer than I've used Rhythmbox and a lot of songs show last played as 'Never'. 
That kinda sucks for shuffle especially on large libraries.

Another possibility is that your database gets corrupted and has to be removed. You lose everything!!!
But with Merge Plays you can restore some of the lost information.

lastexport.py is used for exporting your listening history (also loved/banned tracks) from last.fm or libre.fm to a text file.

MERGEPLAYS.PY
-------------
This script that will parse a text file and add each play to the current total in Rhythmbox OR create one if it's never been played. It

USAGE
 * Get a dump for your username.
     python ./lastexport.py -u your_lastfm_username -o dump.txt
 * Run Merge Plays
    python ./mergeplays.py dump.txt


RATE5LOVED.PY
-------------
This script will take an export of your loved track from the last.fm website and make all those tracks 5 stars.
It works in the same way as merge plays and will be integrated soon.

USAGE
 * Pull your loved tracks with lastexport:
     python ./lastexport.py -u your_lastfm_username -t loved -o loved.txt
 * Merge with database:
     python ./rate5loved.py loved.txt


Notes
-----
If you use the default file names (dump.txt/loved.txt) the scripts will look for those files by default if no argument is given.
