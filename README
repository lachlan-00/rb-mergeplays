Rhythmbox data from Last.fm
GPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>

Currently the project is a single script:
 * mergeplays3.py (replacing mergeplays.py)


ABOUT THE SCRIPT
----------------
I have used Last.fm for a lot longer than I've used Rhythmbox and a lot of songs show last played as 'Never'. 
That kinda sucks for shuffle especially on large libraries.

Another possibility is that your database gets corrupted and has to be removed. You lose everything!!!
But with Merge Plays you can restore some of the lost information.

lastexport.py is used for exporting your listening history (also loved/banned tracks) from last.fm or libre.fm to a text file.

(the LastToLibre project seems dead now so you can grab the latest python3 version from my github)

LASTEXPORT3.PY
--------------
This script will pull data from last fm into a tab separated text file.

Get a play count dump for your username.
 * python3 ./lastexport3.py -u your_lastfm_username -t scrobbles -o dump.txt

Get a list of loved tracks for your username.
 * python3 ./lastexport3.py -u your_lastfm_username -t loved -o dump.txt


MERGEPLAYS3.PY
--------------
This script will parse a text file and add each play to the current total in Rhythmbox OR create one if it's never been played. It can also rate your loved tracks 5 stars.

TO MERGE YOUR PLAYS INTO RHYTHMBOX
 * Run Merge Plays
    python3 ./mergeplays3.py /d:dump.txt

TO RATE YOUR LOVED TRACKS AS 5 STARS
 * Run Merge Plays
    python3 ./mergeplays3.py /l:loved.txt

The default behaviour is to output a second text file with the results of the script.
(mergeplays-playcount-PROCESSED.txt & mergeplays-loved-PROCESSED.txt)

The new files will add an additional column at the end of each row.
 * 0 means that the song was not processed
 * 1 means the song was processed successfully

The next time you run over this file it will skip songs that have been processed.


OPTIONS AND COMMAND SWITCHES
----------------------------
There are limited options to allow you to change script behaviour.

/fuzzy

Last.fm may be missing the album from your play which mergeplays will skip by default.
This switch will only search for the Song Title and Artist, matching the first result.

/overwrite

This will allow you to use the same file over and over without duplicating results.
If your dump file has not been processed before it will rename to original to $(filename).old


Notes
-----
 * Rhythmbox must be closed to edit the database
 * If you use the default file names (dump.txt/loved.txt) the scripts will look for those files in you working directory by default if no argument is given.
 * Because of the speed increase (thanks to https://github.com/dopstar) I have merged rate5loved into into mergeplays3.py
 * There is now an additional column at the end of each row in the output file.
