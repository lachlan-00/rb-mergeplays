Rhythmbox data from Last.fm
GPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>

Currently the project is two script files:
 * mergeplays3.py (replacing merplays.py)
 * rate5loved.py

Because of the speed increase (thanks to https://github.com/dopstar) I'll be merging rate5loved into into mergeplays3.py)


ABOUT THE SCRIPTS
-----------------
I have used Last.fm for a lot longer than I've used Rhythmbox and a lot of songs show last played as 'Never'. 
That kinda sucks for shuffle especially on large libraries.

Another possibility is that your database gets corrupted and has to be removed. You lose everything!!!
But with Merge Plays you can restore some of the lost information.

lastexport.py is used for exporting your listening history (also loved/banned tracks) from last.fm or libre.fm to a text file.

(the LastToLibre project seems dead now so you can grab the latest python3 version from my github)

LASTEXPORT3.PY
--------------
This script will pull data from last fm into a tab separated text file.

Get a play count dump for your username.
 * python3 ./lastexport3.py -u your_lastfm_username -t scrobbles -o dump.txt

Get a list of loved tracks for your username.
 * python3 ./lastexport3.py -u your_lastfm_username -t loved -o dump.txt


MERGEPLAYS3.PY
--------------
This script will parse a text file and add each play to the current total in Rhythmbox OR create one if it's never been played. It can also rate your loved tracks 5 stars.

TO MERGE YOUR PLAYS INTO RHYTHMBOX
 * Run Merge Plays
    python3 ./mergeplays3.py /d:dump.txt

TO RATE YOUR LOVED TRACKS AS 5 STARS
 * Run Merge Plays
    python3 ./mergeplays3.py /l:loved.txt


Notes
-----
If you use the default file names (dump.txt/loved.txt) the scripts will look for those files by default if no argument is given.
